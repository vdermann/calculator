# Calculator
This is a basic calculator developed as a learning project from The Odin Project. It allows you to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The main idea was to reinforce concepts of DOM manipulation, event handling, and create something interactive and functional.

## Features
-Performs the four basic mathematical operations.
-Supports decimal entry.
-Allows you to change the sign of numbers (positive/negative).
-Includes clear buttons to delete the last digit or reset the entire operation.
-Displays a brief history of the current operation at the top.
-Interaction is possible using both the interface buttons and the keypad for added convenience.

## Experience developing it
Although at first I found the amount of validation required to make the calculator work properly somewhat overwhelming, I was eager to do a project like this on my own and ended up achieving it.
I think it's been a good project to further develop DOM manipulation and try to implement good practices.
With this project, for the first time after finishing it, I sat down and tried to refactor it because I admit I wrote some pretty messy code.
That's all. Thank you and best regards.
